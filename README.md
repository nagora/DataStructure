DataStructure Algorithm

Selection Sort
===============
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by  finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

Bubble Sort
===========
Repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order
